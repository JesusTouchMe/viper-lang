# Viper

## About viper

Viper is a statically-typed, compiled programming language that compiles to vipIR, primarily developed by [@solar-mist](https://github.com/solar-mist). It features its own standard library and Visual Studio Code syntax highlighting.

## Supported platforms

Currently, viper only supports x86_64 Unix systems that follow the System V ABI, however support for Windows systems will be added in future.

## Getting Started

To install the viper compiler, see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/viper-org/viper-lang/wiki/Getting-Started) page on our wiki - this page contains instructions about how to set up your viper compiler.

The wiki also contains information about the language itself and all of the features it provides

## Contributing

The main way to contribute to viper is through a pull request on GitHub. Simply make your changes on a fork, then create a pull request to master, where it will be reviewed by one of our reviewers.
If you would like to report an issue with the compiler, without making the changes yourself, please create an issue at [Issues](https://github.com/viper-org/viper-lang/issues) to notify the development team.
